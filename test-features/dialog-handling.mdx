# Dialog Handling

QA.tech automatically handles browser dialogs that appear during test execution, ensuring your tests continue running smoothly without manual intervention.

## Supported Dialog Types

Our testing platform can capture and handle four types of browser dialogs:

<Card title="Alert Dialogs" icon="triangle-exclamation">
  **`window.alert()`** - Simple notification dialogs with just an "OK" button.
  **Handled by default:** ✅ Yes - automatically accepted and text captured
</Card>

<Card title="Confirm Dialogs" icon="circle-question">
  **`window.confirm()`** - Dialogs with "OK" and "Cancel" options. **Handled by
  default:** ❌ No - can be enabled on request
</Card>

<Card title="Prompt Dialogs" icon="message-question">
  **`window.prompt()`** - Dialogs that request text input from the user.
  **Handled by default:** ❌ No - can be enabled on request
</Card>

<Card title="Before Unload Dialogs" icon="door-open">
  **`window.onbeforeunload`** - Dialogs shown when leaving a page with unsaved
  changes. **Handled by default:** ❌ No - can be enabled on request
</Card>

## Default Behavior

### Alert Dialogs (Automatic)

By default, QA.tech automatically:

- **Captures** the alert message text
- **Accepts** the alert (clicks "OK")
- **Includes** the alert text in the test result

When an alert appears during a test action, agent will see output like:

```
Successfully clicked submit button. Alert(s) shown: alert: Please fill in all required fields
```

### Other Dialog Types (On Request)

Confirm, prompt, and beforeunload dialogs are not handled by default but can be configured if needed. Contact our support team if your application requires handling these dialog types.

## Why Browser Dialogs Should Be Avoided

<Warning>
  **Avoid using `alert()`, `confirm()`, and `prompt()` dialogs in modern web
  applications.**
</Warning>

All browser dialogs (`alert()`, `confirm()`, `prompt()`) are legacy APIs with significant limitations:

- **Synchronous Blocking** - All JavaScript execution halts while a dialog is open, blocking UI updates and network requests
- **Cannot be styled** - Appearance varies between browsers and cannot be customized to match your design system
- **Limited functionality** - Support only basic text and buttons, no rich content or custom button labels
- **Poor mobile experience** - May appear at OS level, breaking app visual flow and scaling inconsistently
- **Accessibility issues** - Screen readers and assistive technologies may not announce dialogs reliably
- **Testing complexity** - Require special handling in automation frameworks, interrupting test flows

## Modern Alternatives

Instead of browser dialogs, use these user-friendly patterns:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Custom Modal Components">
    Build modals with your UI framework that match your design system, support
    rich content, and include proper ARIA attributes for accessibility.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Inline Validation & Messaging">
    Embed validation errors or status messages directly adjacent to form fields,
    providing real-time feedback without interruption.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Toast & Snackbar Notifications">
    Use non-blocking notification systems for success messages, warnings, and
    informational alerts that don't halt user interaction.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Dedicated Confirmation Flows">
    For destructive actions, use confirmation screens or inline panels that show
    contextual details and require explicit confirmation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Migration Strategy

If your application currently uses browser dialogs:

<Note>
  **Gradual Replacement Approach:** 1. **Audit** - Identify all occurrences of
  `alert`, `confirm`, `prompt` in your codebase 2. **Prioritize** - Start with
  high-traffic, user-facing areas first 3. **Build** - Develop reusable modal
  and notification components 4. **Replace** - Swap native dialogs
  incrementally, verifying behavior 5. **Test** - Ensure custom components work
  with your automated tests
</Note>

## Testing Dialog-Heavy Applications

If your application currently uses browser dialogs extensively:

<Note>
  **Contact Support:** Reach out to our team at [hi@qa.tech](mailto:hi@qa.tech)
  to discuss: - Enabling additional dialog types for your tests - Migration
  strategies for replacing dialogs with better UX patterns - Custom handling for
  specific dialog scenarios
</Note>

## Technical Implementation

When the AI agent encounters dialogs during test execution:

- **Alert dialogs** are automatically detected, captured, and accepted
- **Dialog text** is included in the test action results and visible in test traces
- **Other dialog types** (confirm, prompt, beforeunload) can be enabled for specific projects upon request
- **Test execution** continues seamlessly after dialog handling

## Best Practices

<Card title="✅ Do" icon="check">
  - Use `alert()` **only** for debugging/development - never in production -
  Replace all browser dialogs with custom modals in production applications -
  Describe dialog expectations clearly in your test goals (e.g., "expect a
  success confirmation after form submission")
</Card>

<Card title="❌ Don't" icon="x">
  - Rely on any browser dialogs (`alert()`, `confirm()`, `prompt()`) for
  production user interfaces - Use dialogs for complex user interactions -
  Expect dialogs to work consistently across all devices and browsers
