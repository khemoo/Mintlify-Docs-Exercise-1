# Gitlab Integration

Automate your QA process by integrating QA.tech with your GitLab CI/CD pipelines. You can trigger test runs automatically on stages, after deployments, on merge requests.

You can trigger an external API as part of your GitLab CI/CD pipeline using a curl command inside your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

## Example: Triggering an API with a POST Request

This example demonstrates how to send a JSON payload to an external API from a pipeline job.

```yaml
trigger_qatech:
  stage: deploy
  variables:
    QATECH_REQUEST_BODY: '{"integrationName": "Gitlab"}'
    API_TOKEN: $QA_TECH_API_TOKEN # Use GitLab secret variable
  script: >
    curl --request POST --url "https://app.qa.tech/api/projects/<PROJECT_ID>/runs"
    --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN"
    --data "${QATECH_REQUEST_BODY}"
```

### Instructions

Update the URL and QA_TECH_API_TOKEN for your project.
You can find these values in your [project settings](https://app.qa.tech/dashboard/current-project/settings/integrations).

### Use a Secret Token

Store your API token securely in GitLab CI/CD variables under Settings > CI/CD > Variables.
Name it QA_TECH_API_TOKEN and use it as shown above to avoid hardcoding secrets.

### Optional Fields

For more information about our API and other integration options, check out our [API Reference](/api-reference/start-the-tests).

## Notes

Make sure the job runs in a stage that suits your pipeline (e.g., deploy, test, etc.).
