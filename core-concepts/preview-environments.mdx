**Preview environments** are temporary, isolated environments created for specific feature branches or pull requests. They allow you to test changes in a production-like environment before merging code into your main branch.

## What are Preview Environments?

Preview environments are dynamically created environments that:

- Deploy your application with the latest changes from a specific branch
- Provide a unique URL for testing the changes
- Are automatically cleaned up after the feature is merged or the branch is deleted
- Enable stakeholders to review and test features before they go live

## Creating Preview Environments

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Environment Settings">
    Go to [**Settings →
    Environments**](https://app.qa.tech/dashboard/current-project/settings/environments)
    in your project dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Preview Environment">
    Click "Add Environment" and select "Preview Environment" as the type.
    Configure the environment with your preview deployment URL pattern.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure URL Pattern">
    Set up the URL pattern to match your preview deployment system (e.g.,
    `https://feature-branch-name.preview.yourapp.com`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Lifecycle Rules">
    Configure automatic cleanup rules and expiration settings for the preview
    environment.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Integration with API

You can trigger test runs against preview environments using the [**Start Run API**](/api-reference/start-run). The API allows you to override environment configurations per application when starting a test run.

## Integration with CI/CD

Use the [QA.tech GitHub Action](https://github.com/QAdottech/run-action) to automatically test preview environments. The action supports:

- **Dynamic URL configuration** - Override environment URLs using `applications_config`
- **Multiple application testing** - Test frontend, backend, and other apps simultaneously
- **Blocking mode** - Wait for test completion before proceeding
- **PR-based deployments** - Automatic testing on pull requests
- **Custom deployment integrations** - Works with Vercel, Netlify, AWS, and other platforms

For complete setup examples and configuration options, see the [GitHub Action documentation](https://github.com/QAdottech/run-action).
