When you have tests that depend on other tests (like a "Login" test that other tests rely on), QA.tech can automatically:

- **Skip running dependency tests** that completed successfully in the last hour
- **Reuse the browser state** (login session, cookies, etc.) from the previous run
- **Start your main tests immediately** with the correct browser state already loaded

This dramatically reduces test execution time while maintaining the same reliability.

## How It Works

### Example Scenario

Let's say you have these tests:

1. **Login Test** (creates a logged-in user session)
2. **Create Order Test** (depends on Login Test)
3. **View Dashboard Test** (depends on Login Test)

**Without optimization:**

- Login Test runs first
- Create Order Test waits for Login Test, then runs
- View Dashboard Test waits for Login Test, then runs

**With dependency output states enabled:**

- Login Test was already run successfully earlier
- Create Order Test starts immediately with saved login session
- View Dashboard Test starts immediately with saved login session
- **Result: Significantly faster execution**

## When Dependency Output States are Used

QA.tech automatically uses dependency output states when:

✅ **Dependency test completed successfully** within the last hour  
✅ **Same environment** (dependencies must match the test environment)  
✅ **Browser state is valid** (login sessions haven't expired)

If any condition isn't met, tests run normally with full dependency chain.

## Benefits & Safety

### ⚡ Faster Execution

Skip redundant dependency tests that recently completed successfully.

### 🔒 Safe & Reliable

Multiple safety checks ensure reliability is never compromised:

- **Time Limits**: Only reuses browser state less than 1 hour old
- **Success Verification**: Only uses state from tests that passed completely
- **Graceful Fallback**: Runs tests normally if dependency output states aren't available

### 🌍 Environment Aware

**Environment Isolation**: Never mixes browser state between different environments - each environment's dependencies are kept separate.

## Common Questions

### Will this affect my test results?

No. Dependency output states only skip tests when we're certain the browser state is identical to what would be achieved by running the dependency. If there's any doubt, the system runs tests normally.

### What if my dependency test fails?

Dependency output states are only used for tests that completed successfully. Failed tests are always re-run.

### What types of browser state are preserved?

The system preserves:

- Login sessions and authentication cookies
- Local storage data
- Session storage data
- Any other browser state your tests create

## Troubleshooting

### My tests are running slower than expected

- Verify your dependency tests completed successfully in the last hour
- Ensure you're running tests in the same environment as recent dependency runs

### Dependency output states aren't being used

- Confirm dependency tests completed successfully within the last hour
- Check that you're testing in the same environment where dependencies ran
