# Guide: Adding and Editing Pages in QA.tech Docs (Mintlify)

This document outlines the process for adding new documentation pages and editing existing ones within the QA.tech documentation repository. The documentation utilizes the **Mintlify** framework and **MDX** for content.

**Target Audience:** QA.tech customers


## Core Files & Concepts

*   **`apps/docs/` directory** Contains all the documentation content files (`.mdx`). Subdirectories within `docs/` (e.g., `core-concepts/`, `best-practices/`) organize the content.
*   **`.mdx` files:** Individual documentation pages written in MDX format. They start with YAML frontmatter.
*   **`docs.json` (root):** The main Mintlify configuration file. It defines the **navigation structure** (sidebar), global styling, integrations, and other core settings for the documentation site.

## Task: Editing an Existing Page

1.  **Identify the File:** Locate the `.mdx` file corresponding to the page requiring edits. The file path often mirrors the URL structure (e.g., the page `docs.qa.tech/core-concepts/overview` might correspond to `docs/core-concepts/overview.mdx`). Check the `navigation` section in `docs.json` to confirm the file path if needed.
2.  **Modify Content:** Access the identified `.mdx` file and make the necessary changes to the text, code examples, or components using MDX syntax.
3.  **Save Changes:** Ensure the modified file is saved.

## Task: Adding a New Page

1.  **Determine Location:** Decide the logical placement for the new page within the existing documentation structure. Identify the appropriate subdirectory within the main content folder (e.g., `docs/best-practices/`, `docs/integrations/`). Create a new subdirectory if necessary.
2.  **Create MDX File:** Generate a new file with the `.mdx` extension in the chosen directory. Use a descriptive, URL-friendly filename (e.g., `docs/integrations/new-service.mdx`).
3.  **Add Frontmatter:** Initialize the file with YAML frontmatter (`---`) to define essential metadata. A `title` is required. A `description` is recommended for clarity and SEO.
    ```mdx
    ---
    title: "Integrating with New Service"
    description: "Step-by-step guide for setting up the New Service integration."
    icon: "puzzle-piece" # Optional: See Icons section below
    ---

    # Integrating with New Service

    Start page content here using MDX...
    ```
4.  **Write Content:** Populate the file with the documentation content using MDX syntax (text, headings, lists, code blocks, Mintlify components like `<Note>`, `<Card>`, `<Steps>`, etc.).
5.  **Update Navigation (`docs.json`):** This step is **essential** for the new page to be visible in the site's sidebar navigation.
    *   Access the `docs.json` file located at the root of the repository.
    *   Navigate to the `navigation` array within the JSON structure.
    *   Find the specific `group` (or `anchor`, `tab`, etc.) where the new page should appear.
    *   Append the **relative path** to the newly created `.mdx` file (***excluding*** the `.mdx` extension) into that group's `pages` array.

    **Example `docs.json` Snippet Modification:**
    ```json
    {
      // ... other config ...
      "navigation": [
        // ... other groups ...
        {
          "group": "Integrations", // Target group found
          "pages": [
            "integrations/trello",
            "integrations/linear",
            "integrations/jira",
            "integrations/status-badges",
            "integrations/new-service" // <-- New page path added
          ]
        },
        // ... other groups ...
      ]
      // ... other config ...
    }
    ```
6.  **Save Changes:** Ensure both the new `.mdx` file and the modified `docs.json` are saved.

## Step guides

Write steps like this, when its something the user has to do

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Status Badge">
    Navigate to [**Settings →
    Integrations**](https://app.qa.tech/dashboard/current-project/settings/integrations?focus=status-badge).
    Find the **Status Badge** section and toggle it to enable.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Badge Options">
    Select which test plan to track with your badge and customize the appearance
    options as needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy Badge Code">
    Copy the generated Markdown, HTML, or URL code to embed the badge in your
    README, documentation, or website.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Links to qa.tech application

we have a special that replaces projectId with current-project, like this

https://app.qa.tech/dashboard/current-project/settings/integrations?focus=status-badge

to link the user into our app from docs, keeping their previously selected project.

## Using Icons

Icons enhance visual navigation and draw attention to specific sections or pages. Mintlify primarily uses icons from two libraries:

1.  **@Font Awesome** (Free set)
2.  **@Lucide**

Icons are typically specified using their string names (e.g., `"book-open"`, `"square-terminal"`, `"puzzle-piece"`).

**Where to Use Icons:**

*   **Navigation (`docs.json`):** Add an `icon` property to `group`, `anchor`, or `tab` objects within the `navigation` structure to display an icon next to that item in the sidebar or top navigation.
    ```json
      "anchors": [
        {
          "name": "Documentation",
          "icon": "book-open-cover", // <-- Icon for Anchor
          "url": "introduction"
        },
        {
          "group": "Core Concepts",
          "icon": "brain-circuit", // <-- Icon for Group (if nested)
          "pages": [
            "core-concepts/overview",
            // ...
          ]
        }
      ]
    ```
*   **Page Frontmatter (`.mdx` files):** Add an `icon` property to a page's frontmatter to display an icon next to its entry in the sidebar.
    ```mdx
    ---
    title: "Email Inbox Testing"
    icon: "inbox" # <-- Icon for Page
    ---
    ```
*   **Mintlify Components:** Some components like `<Card>`, `<Step>`, `<Accordion>`, or the global `anchors` in `docs.json` accept an `icon` prop. Refer to the specific component documentation for usage.
    ```jsx
    <Card title="My Card" icon="link" href="/some/path">
      Card content...
    </Card>
    ```
*   **Font Awesome Specifics:** For Font Awesome icons, you can optionally specify an `iconType` (e.g., `"solid"`, `"regular"`, `"brands"`) if you need a specific style variant, though often the default works well. This is usually set in the same place as the `icon` property.

When adding or editing pages or navigation elements, consider adding relevant icons to improve user experience.
